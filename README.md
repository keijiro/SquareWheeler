**Square Wheeler** is a simple infinite runner game where you control a boxy car with cube-shaped wheels instead of circular ones. The car is prone to flipping over, and the challenge lies in driving it as far as possible.

This game was developed for the "unity1week" game jam event. You can play the game on the following page:
